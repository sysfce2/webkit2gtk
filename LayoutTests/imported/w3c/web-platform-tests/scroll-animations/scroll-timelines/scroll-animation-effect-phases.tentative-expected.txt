FAIL Playback rate affects whether active phase boundary is inclusive. assert_equals: Animation effect is in before phase when current time is 0% (progress is null with 'none' fill mode) expected (object) null but got (number) 0
FAIL Verify that (play -> pause -> play) doesn't change phase/progress. assert_equals: expected (object) null but got (number) 0
FAIL Pause in before phase, scroll timeline into active phase, animation should remain in the before phase assert_equals: expected (object) null but got (number) 0
FAIL Pause in before phase, set animation current time to be in active range, animation should become active. Scrolling should have no effect. assert_equals: expected (object) null but got (number) 0
PASS Make scroller inactive, then set current time to an in range time
PASS Animation effect is still applied after pausing and making timeline inactive.
PASS Make timeline inactive, force style update then pause the animation. No crashing indicates test success.
