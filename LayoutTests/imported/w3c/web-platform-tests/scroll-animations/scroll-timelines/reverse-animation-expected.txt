PASS Setting current time while reverse-pending preserves currentTime
PASS Reversing an animation inverts the playback rate
FAIL Reversing an animation resets a sticky start time. assert_approx_equals: values do not match for "undefined" expected 100 +/- 0.125 but got 40
PASS Reversing an animation does not cause it to leave the pending state
PASS Reversing an animation does not cause it to resolve the ready promise
PASS Reversing an animation with a negative playback rate should cause the animation to play in a forward direction
FAIL Reversing when when playbackRate == 0 should preserve the playback rate assert_approx_equals: values do not match for "Anchors to range start boundary when playback rate is zero" expected 0 +/- 0.125 but got 50
FAIL Reversing an idle animation aligns startTime with the rangeEnd boundary assert_approx_equals: values do not match for "animation.startTime should be at its effect end" expected 100 +/- 0.125 but got -100
PASS Reversing an animation without an active timeline throws an InvalidStateError
PASS Reversing an animation plays a pausing animation
PASS Reversing should use the negative pending playback rate
